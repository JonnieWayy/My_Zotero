    Abstract: The concept of GenAI has been developed for decades. Until recently, it has impressed us with substantial breakthroughs in natural language processing and computer vision, actively engaging in industrial scenarios. Noticing the practical challenges, e.g., limited learning resources, and overly dependencies on scientific discovery empiricism, we nominate large-scale generative simulation artificial intelligence (LS-GenAI) as the next hotspot for GenAI to connect.
