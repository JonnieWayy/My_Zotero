Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs), like LLaMA, have exhibited remarkable performances across various tasks. Nevertheless, when deployed to specific domains such as law or medicine, the models still confront the challenge of a deficiency in domain-specific knowledge and an inadequate capability to leverage that knowledge to resolve domain-related problems. In this paper, we focus on the legal domain and explore how to inject domain knowledge during the continual training stage and how to design proper supervised finetune tasks to help the model tackle practical issues. Moreover, to alleviate the hallucination problem during model’s generation, we add a retrieval module and extract relevant articles before the model answers any queries. Augmenting with the extracted evidence, our model could generate more reliable responses. We release our data and model at https://github.com/AndrewZhe/ lawyer-llama.
1 Introduction
Enhancing open-source large language models with instruction tuning, models such as Vicunna (Chiang et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023) have achieved remarkable performance in various general tasks. However, due to the lack of data and improper training paradigm, adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains like legal or medical domains remains a challenging task. On one hand, current LLMs are primarily trained on general corpora such as Common Crawl and Wikipedia, with limited exposure to domainspecific resources. Therefore, they lack the necessary knowledge required for specific domains. On the other hand, the strategy to analyze and solve domain-specific tasks might diverge significantly from what the model has required within general domains. Even if the model could access all the

Figure 1: Comparison between LLaMA continually trained only on general Chinese Corpus (BELLE) and our Lawyer LLaMA which is specially designed for the legal domain. It can be seen that BELLE lacks domainspecific knowledge, like legal age of marriage. What’s more, even if the necessary knowledge, like the specific law article is given, the original LLaMA still cannot use it to solve a practical problem. See English translations in Figure 4.

knowledge within a domain, applying them to solve practical problems remains a formidable undertaking. In this paper, we focus on the legal domain to explore how to adapt LLMs to specific domains. We will discuss the potential challenges and corresponding solutions to them.
Figure 1 shows the responses of LLaMA pretrained on the general corpus (BELLE) and our Lawyer LLaMA which is designed to solve legal issues. For Question A, the right answer is what Lawyer LLaMA provides, that the legal age of marriage is 22 for men and 20 for women. Obviously, BELLE lacks such domain-specific knowledge and

1

can only answer 18, which is the age with full civil capacity. What general LLMs lack is not only the knowledge but also the method to use them to solve domain-specific problems. For example, in Question B, even if the necessary law article is provided, BELLE cannot figure out the most important/relevant part to the user’s query that the wife gave birth less than a year ago and thus the husband is not allowed to file for divorce at this time.
The poor performance of BELLE indicates the LLMs pre-trained in the general domain cannot be applied directly to solve legal problems. For large models to be applied in the field of law, they need to possess the following three capabilities: 1. Convey accurate/precise meaning without ambiguity. In the legal domain, just replacing a single word could influence the establishment of legal relationships and obligations, potentially leading to dramatically different consequences. For example, the words deposit (定金) and down payment (订金) in Chinese are only different by one character, but their meanings and legal effects are completely different in contract law. 2. Understand and distinguish legal terminology. There are many concepts that only appear in the legal domain, like juridical person (法人). Even for widely used words, their meanings could be slightly different in the legal domain. For example, the word wife does not necessarily imply a legally recognized and protected marital relationship in daily life, but in the specific field of law, when referring to wife, it definitely implies a lawful marital relationship. 3. Be able to analyze practical cases. Real-world scenarios are always complex and varied. Models need to have the ability to identify legal terminology and apply legal theories to analyze specific issues.
To build a model that can apply legal knowledge correctly and solve practical problems in the legal domain, we adopt the following four steps, based on the LLaMA model (Touvron et al., 2023):
1. Injecting Legal Knowledge: We collect a large amount of raw text in the legal domain, such as law articles, judicial interpretations, and judicial documents of the People’s Court of China. We then apply continue-training to help the model learn legal knowledge.
2. Training to Learn Domain-specific Skills: The ability to use domain knowledge could be learned when solving practical tasks, such as concept interpretation, case analysis and legal

consultation. Therefore, we collect a set of real queries of those tasks and generate corresponding answers using ChatGPT1. Then we do supervised finetuning using these data to teach the model how to solve domain-specific tasks with proper knowledge.
3. Augmenting with External Knowledge: To alleviate the hallucination problem in large language models and to enable the model to generate more accurate and faithful replies, we additionally introduce an information retrieval module. Before generating each response, we first utilize the user’s query and context information to retrieve relevant law articles that can serve as evidence to the query, and then base our responses on these law articles.
2 Data Collection
2.1 Pre-training Corpus
To improve model performance on Chinese legal consultation, we employ two kinds of corpora to continually pre-train the LLaMA model (Touvron et al., 2023). We first train the model on a general multilingual corpus to enhance its ability to represent Chinese. We then use a Chinese legal corpus to augment the model with legal knowledge.
Multilingual General Corpus Since LLaMA has been pre-trained mainly on a corpus of English and other languages using either the Latin or Cyrillic scripts, it may have an imperfect performance to comprehend and to generate Chinese sentences. For example, we find that the original LLaMA always generates English responses to Chinese queries, and the responses might also be irrelevant. We, therefore, continually pre-train LLaMA on the Chinese general corpus. Following previous works (d’Autume et al., 2019; Tao et al., 2023), we also collect English corpus for memory replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting.
To construct the Chinese general corpus, we sample articles from WuDaoCorpora (Yuan et al., 2021), CLUECorpus2020 (Xu et al., 2020b), and the Simplified Chinese edition of Wikipedia. For the English general corpus, we sample articles from C4 Corpus (Raffel et al., 2020).
Chinese Legal Corpus Previous work (Lee et al., 2019) reveals that language models can leverage

knowledge learned from a domain-specific corpus. And such models can handle tasks in the corresponding domain better than the models pre-trained with general corpus only. To augment our model with Chinese legal knowledge, we collect articles from the websites of China Courts, including judgment documents, law articles, judicial interpretations, court news, and various articles for law popularization.
2.2 National Judicial Examination
National Judicial Examination is a closed-book exam that applicants must pass to be certified as a lawyer or a judge. It is a comprehensive evaluation of legal knowledge and professional skills for legal practitioners, thus a model could learn legal skills through practicing on the questions from such exams. We use JEC-QA (Zhong et al., 2020a) to construct our data. JEC-QA includes 26,365 multiple-choice and multiple-answer questions but it does not contain any explanations for the answers. In order to provide more detailed evidence and reasoning procedures on how to solve such problems, we ask the ChatGPT to give an explanation for every answer. Below shows an example from our collected data. See the English translation in Table 4.
Question: 关于交通肇事罪与其他犯罪关系的论
述，下列选项是正确的吗？丁酒后驾驶交通肇事 后，继续驾车到处冲撞，造成五死九伤，应定交 通肇事罪。
Response: 根据《中华人民共和国刑法》规定，醉
酒后驾驶机动车辆，发生重大交通事故，构成交 通肇事罪。丁酒后驾驶发生交通事故，已经构成 交通肇事罪。但是，丁继续驾车到处冲撞，造成 五死九伤，已经超出了交通肇事罪的范畴，应当 认定为危害公共安全罪。因此，丁应当被定罪为 危害公共安全罪，而不是交通肇事罪。
2.3 Legal Consultation
We sample seed questions from an open-source dataset of legal consultation (Chen, 2018) and use ChatGPT to generate responses. We collect both one-turn responses and multi-turn dialogues with well-crafted prompts. To improve the faithfulness of generated responses, we adopt a law article retrieval component to search related law articles for a given question. The retrieved law articles are appended to the input prompt, helping ChatGPT to generate more faithful responses.

One-turn Responses To generate the response to a legal consultation question, we ask ChatGPT to act as a lawyer and respond to a client. In the input prompt, we list six requirements that the generated responses should meet: (1) properly citing law articles, (2) giving well-founded analyses based on the facts of the case and law articles, (3) responding comprehensively and analyzing the potential possibilities, (4) asking appropriate questions to dig out facts to assist in further answers, (5) using plain language, (6) giving preliminary legal opinions and consulting conclusions.
In the following example (see the English translation in Table 5), ChatGPT generates a response to a question regarding the legal age of marriage. It cites a law article in Marriage Law of the People’s Republic of China and indicates several special circumstances.
Question: 我和我对象想结婚，我想问一下，结婚
的法定婚龄是几岁啊
Response: 根据《中华人民共和国婚姻法》规定，
男 女 结 婚 的 法 定 婚 龄 为 男 满22周 岁 ， 女 满20周 岁。未达到法定婚龄的人不得结婚。但有特殊情 况的可以提前结婚，需要得到父母或者监护人的 书面同意，并经当地婚姻登记机关审查批准。
Multi-turn Dialogues To generate multi-turn dialogues for a legal consultation question, we design two different prompts, asking ChatGPT to act as a client and as a lawyer, respectively. We use these two prompts alternately, together with the dialogue history, as the input to ChatGPT.
In the following example (English translation in Table 6), the client gives a follow-up question on the marriage procedure after the first response from the lawyer, actively participating in the conversation.
Client: 我和我对象想结婚，我想问一下，结婚的
法定婚龄是几岁啊
Lawyer: 根据中华人民共和国婚姻法，男女都要
满22周岁才可以结婚，不足22周岁的男女不得自 行结婚。但是，如果特殊情况需要提前结婚， 可以向婚姻登记机关提出申请审核。如果您有其 他方面的疑问，也可以告诉我，我可以帮助您进 行解答。如果您有其他方面的疑问，也可以告诉 我，我可以帮助您进行解答。
Client: 我知道，听别人说婚姻需要提前办理一些
手续，那我需要准备哪些证件和资料呢？是否需 要提前办理健康检查和体检？
Lawyer: 是的，婚姻登记需要您准备一些证件和资

料，包括：...
Retrieval Augmented Generation We observe that ChatGPT tends to provide law articles that are outdated, or do not exist at all when generating responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination (Ji et al., 2023b). We attempt to alleviate this problem by providing related law articles to ChatGPT. For a one-turn response, we append the top 3 related law articles selected by a law article retrieval model to the input prompt. For a multi-turn dialogue, we assume that the topic of the conversation will not change and use the same 3 law articles across the dialogue. We will explore strategies to dynamically retrieve related law articles during each turn of the dialogue.
In the following example (English translation in Table 7), we retrieve 3 law articles to facilitate a more faithful generation. Note that two of them are irrelevant to the consultation and ChatGPT is able to ignore them in its response.

In total, we collect about 16,000 one-turn responses and 5,000 dialogues with 2 or 3 turns.
3 Training Process
Figure 3 illustrates how we fine-tune the opensource model LLaMA step by step to make it suitable for the Chinese legal domain.
Due to the scarce Chinese text that LLaMA used during its training process, our initial task is to enhance LLaMA’s ability to comprehend Chinese (s1 in Figure 3). Then, we supplement the model with the legal knowledge in Chinese that it lacks (s4 in Figure 3), and teach the model to use the knowledge to solve practical problems through downstream tasks like case analysis (s7 in Figrue 3). Finally, to further improve the reliability of the model’s responses, we introduce a law article retrieval module, enabling the model to generate responses with evidence (s12 in Figure 3).
3.1 Enhancing LLaMA’s Ability in Chinese
To improve the comprehension and generation ability in Chinese, we continually pre-train LLaMA on the Chinese General Corpus introduced in Section 2.1. The first problem we meet is that many Chinese characters are not included in the vocabulary of LLaMA. Actually, only 700 Chinese characters are included and LLaMA uses bytes to decompose other Chinese characters in UTF-8 encoding. To improve the decoding efficiency of Chinese sentences, Cui et al. (2023) expand the vocabulary by adding common Chinese characters and re-training these newly added word embeddings along with the model parameters. However, our prior study shows that expanding the vocabulary does not seem to bring further improvement on downstream Chinese NLU tasks. We therefore choose to keep LLaMA’s vocabulary unchanged during the training. Another question is whether we should continue pre-training on Chinese corpus solely, or we should also add texts in English. We decide to use a mixture corpus of both English and Chinese, because we believe many complex reasoning abilities may come from the pre-training on English and we expect the model to keep them during our continual pre-training. Please refer to Section 2.1 for detailed information about the training data.

3.2 Injecting Legal Knowledge
To make up for the deficiency of legal knowledge in the original LLaMA model, we collect a variety of plain Chinese texts in the legal domain, including law articles and judicial interpretations, for further continual training. We also add general texts to prevent our model from overfitting the legal corpus.
3.3 Learning Reasoning Skills
Solving practical problems requires the model to have reasoning skills in the legal domain. To this end, we select supervised data from downstream tasks and train our model following the instructiontuning method. We collect question-answer pairs about distinguishing terminologies and case analysis from JEC-QA, and ask the ChatGPT to provide detailed explanations for them. During training, the QA pairs are treated as instructions and our model is required to give explanations. Furthermore, we

collect a set of queries that real-world users consulted with lawyers from Chen (2018), and obtain corresponding responses through ChatGPT. Then we use the collected supervised data to train the model in providing proper responses to specific queries.
3.4 Retrieving Relevant Law Articles
As China is a country adopting the civil law, law articles are necessary whenever a judge makes a judgment or a lawyer gives advice. However, our preliminary experiment shows that even if the model repeatedly learns the articles during its continual training phase, it cannot use them correctly when generating a response. It might refer to an irrelevant law article or it may replace a terminology with a semantically similar word that actually has a drastically different meaning in the legal domain. To make the model produce more reliable responses,

5

we incorporate it with a law article retrieval module.
To train the retrieval module, we first collect some user questions for legal consultation and ask legal professionals to annotate up to 3 necessary law articles to answer each question. We then train a law article retrieval model based on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019). It could achieve 0.85 Recall@1 and 0.94 Recall@5 on the held-out testing set. In fact, law article classification is not a new task. Previous works (Zhong et al., 2020b, 2018) predict the necessary law articles for judgment based on the fact descriptions in judicial documents. We do not directly adopt such classifiers because there is a huge gap between the fact descriptions in judicial documents and user queries in daily life. Fact descriptions are formal and wellwritten, encompassing the complete cause, process, and outcome of an incident. However, user queries are colloquially posed and contain only limited, incomplete information, such as "I want a divorce, what should I do?". Thus, the classifiers trained on fact descriptions cannot perform well in practical scenarios.
When we directly concatenate the retrieved law articles and the user’s question as new input, we find that the model tends to quote all the provided law articles in its response, without distinguishing whether they were truly relevant to the current scenario. Given that our law article retrieval module cannot guarantee all retrieved articles are highly relevant to the user’s question, this behavior of the model will introduce more noise. To address this problem, we add irrelevant articles to the context during training, forcing the model to ignore that distracted information. Besides, we modify the prompt during inference, and explicitly inform the model that there might be irrelevant information among the provided law articles, for example, " There may be irrelevant articles in the reference articles, so please avoid quoting those unrelated articles when replying.."
4 Experiments
Lawyer LLaMA is a generative dialogue model, like ChatGPT and ChatGLM. Such a large language model cannot only respond to dialogue queries from humans, but can also handle many NLP tasks like text classification, and multiplechoice question answering. To evaluate the zeroshot performance of our Lawyer LLaMA at dif-

ferent training stages, we transfer every employed task to a multiple-choice task. The model can then predict by choosing a text with the lowest perplexity, without any fine-tuning on specific tasks. Our experiments are based on LLaMA-7B.
4.1 Evaluation on General Tasks
We first wonder how the ability to solve general NLP tasks of LLaMA changes, when we continuously train it on different corpora or with different supervised-fine-tuning datasets. For example, we can examine whether or not the model performance of English reasoning tasks will deteriorate after continually pre-trained on Chinese corpora.
Following previous work (Biderman et al., 2023), we collect both English and Chinese general tasks of various domains, including natural language inference, sentiment analysis, commonsense reasoning, dialogue question answering, etc.
The results are shown in the left part of Table 1. Comparing the results of s0 and s1, we can find LLaMA obtain an improvement of +5.3% accuracy on C3 (Sun et al., 2020), a Chinese question answering dataset, after continually pre-trained on Multilingual General Corpus. When we focus on English commonsense reasoning, the model performance on SciQ (Welbl et al., 2017) and PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020) at s1 is also not worse than that at s0. It shows that pre-training on Multilingual General Corpus can enhance the model to represent Chinese, without sacrificing its ability to represent English.
We then compare the results of CMNLI (Xu et al., 2020a) of s2 and s3, s7 and s9/s8/s6. We can find the model at s3/s9/s8/s6, which are fine-tuned with Judicial Examination examples and legal consultations, can handle the Chinese NLI task better, with an improvement up to +9.3% accuracy. However, there are no CMNLI-style questions exist in our collected Judicial Examination examples and legal consultations. Thus, we guess the model may be able to further enhance its ability to comprehend and reason in Chinese via learning Judicial Examination instances and legal consultations.
Unfortunately, we also find the model fails to handle English NLI and sentiment analysis tasks. At all stages, the model can only output Yes for all MRPC examples (Dolan and Brockett, 2005). And when we continually train LLaMA, it cannot obtain obvious improvement for SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013). We guess it is because there are not

enough SFT examples of English NLI and sentiment analysis. Then the model cannot understand the instructions in the prompts of such a task.
4.2 Evaluation on Chinese Legal Tasks
Beyond handling general NLP tasks, we mainly concern with whether Lawyer LLaMA can learn legal knowledge and solve domain-specific tasks. Therefore, we construct several Chinese legal tasks to evaluate the domain-specific performance of our model.
We first create multiple-choice tasks based on the objective questions of Chinese Judicial Examination (JE). For each question of JE, there are four human-written choices, among which one to four choices can be the correct answers. Since we evaluate zero-shot model performance, the model can select only one answer with the lowest perplexity. Therefore, we only evaluate the questions with one correct choice for the legal tasks. And these questions can be divided into two parts: Concept Discrimination and Scenario Planning, which are denoted as JE-C and JE-S.
Since our Chinese Legal Corpus and legal consultation datasets mainly focus on the Law of Marriage, we also examine Lawyer LLaMA’s ability to solve tasks about the Law of Marriage at every training stage. In this work, we collect judgment documents from the website of China Courts, and

design classification tasks: to predict the causes of action for each document. To reduce noise, we only select verdicts of the civil first-instance.
In this work, we collect 4,875 verdicts about marriage to construct a 4-class task (CAM), and 10K verdicts about property for a 10-class task (CAP). For more details, please refer to Appendix A.
We list the results of each Chinese legal task in Table 1. Compared with s0, continually pretrained on Chinese Legal Corpus can bring the model at s4 an improvement of more than +21.6% accuracy on CAM. It shows the model can learn knowledge about marriage from the Chinese Legal Corpus. However, we find at s1 the model performance obviously deteriorates on CAM and CAP, after training on Multilingual General Corpus. Although results of C3 indicate the model at s1 can represent Chinese text better than it at s0, it still loses the ability to comprehend judgment documents. We guess the tremendous pre-training corpus of LLaMA might contain a part of legal texts, and then the original LLaMA can handle simple legal classification tasks like CAM and CAP. But the texts in Multilingual General Corpus are mainly news and Wikipedia pages, which belong to a different domain from legal texts.
Comparing the results of JE-C and JE-S at s0/s4/s7, we find that training LLaMA with Chi-

Question 1: 什么是夫妻共同财产

BELLE: 夫妻共
同财产是指夫妻 在婚姻关系中取 得的任何财产， 包括但不限于 工资、奖金、股 票、房产等。

ChatGLM: 夫妻共同财产是指夫妻双方在婚 姻期间共同积累的财产，包括夫妻共同居 住的房屋、共同拥有的财产、共同支付的工 资、奖金等收入，以及共同承担的债务等。 根据中国法律，夫妻共同财产是夫妻双方 在婚姻期间共同积累的财产，除非有特别约 定，否则属于夫妻共同财产。在离婚时，夫
妻共同财产应当平等分割。 夫妻共同财产的分割比例由夫妻双方协商 确定，如果无法协商，则按照下列比例分
割 ：(一)妻 子 获 得 财 产 的 比 例 应 当 低 于 丈
夫；(二)妻子获得财产的比例应当低于丈夫
获得财产的比例；...

Lawyer LLaMA: 夫妻共同财产是指夫妻在 婚姻关系存续期间所得的工资、奖金、劳 务报酬、生产、经营、投资的收益、知识产 权的收益、继承或者受赠的财产等，以及其 他应当归共同所有的财产。根据《民法典》
第一千零六十二条规定，夫妻共同财产归夫 妻共同所有，夫妻对共同财产有平等的处理 权。因此，夫妻共同财产是夫妻共同所有，
夫妻双方都有权享有和管理。

Question 2: 离婚和无效婚姻的区别

BELLE: 离婚和 无效婚姻的区别 在于，离婚是指 夫妻关系已经结 束，而无效婚姻 是指夫妻关系从 未存在过。

ChatGLM: 离婚和无效婚姻是指在婚姻制度 中的两种不同状态。 离婚是指婚姻关系已经无效或被撤销，双 方可以通过法律程序结束婚姻关系。离婚的
效力取决于婚姻无效的原因，如果婚姻无效 是因为双方没有感情或没有按照法律规定结 婚，那么离婚就是有效的。如果婚姻无效是 因为婚姻本身存在问题，例如违反了法律规 定或没有感情，那么离婚就无效。 无效婚姻是指婚姻关系没有依法成立，或者 依法成立的婚姻关系本身存在缺陷。无效婚
姻的效力取决于婚姻无效的原因。如果婚姻 无效是因为双方没有感情或没有按照法律规
定结婚，那么婚姻就是无效的。如果婚姻无 效是因为婚姻本身存在问题，例如违反了法 律规定或没有感情，那么婚姻就是无效的。 因此，离婚和无效婚姻之间的区别在于婚姻 的无效原因和婚姻的效力。离婚是婚姻关系 已经无效或被撤销，而无效婚姻是指婚姻关 系没有依法成立或依法成立的婚姻关系本身
存在缺陷。

Lawyer LLaMA: 离婚和无效婚姻是两种不同 的情况。离婚是指夫妻双方自愿解除婚姻关 系，而无效婚姻是指在一定情况下，婚姻关 系从一开始就没有成立或被认定无效。 根据《民法典》第一千零五十一条规定，如 果存在以下情形之一，婚姻将被视为无效： 重婚、有禁止结婚的亲属关系、未到法定婚 龄。如果婚姻被认定为无效，那么夫妻双方 并不具备夫妻的权利和义务，也就不存在离 婚的问题。 而对于无效婚姻的财产处理，根据《民法 典》第一千零五十四条规定，无效的或者 被撤销的婚姻自始没有法律约束力，同居期 间所得的财产，由当事人协议处理；协议不 成的，由人民法院根据照顾无过错方的原则 判决。同时，对于重婚导致的无效婚姻的财 产处理，不得侵害合法婚姻当事人的财产权
益。 此外，《民法典》第一千零六十三条规定了 夫妻共同财产和个人财产的范围，其中一方 的婚前财产属于个人财产。因此，如果婚姻 被认定为无效，夫妻双方的婚前财产仍属于 各自所有。 综上所述，离婚和无效婚姻是两种不同的情 况，需要根据具体情况进行判断。如果您需 要进一步了解相关法律问题，建议您咨询专 业律师。

Table 2: Case Study (Legal Concept). See the English translations in Table 8.

nese legal texts and general SFT examples can bring an improvement of more than +3.9% accuracy on JE-C and +2.85% accuracy on JE-S. It shows the model can handle legal tasks like Judicial Examination better after injecting legal knowledge. However, when the model is trained on SFT data with the form of dialogue, it seems to fail to solve Judicial Examination. We think it might be due to the dissimilarity between examination questions and consulting queries.
We compare the results of every stage comprehensively, we find the model at s12 can obviously outperform the model at s0 on most tasks, with an improvement of +8.5% accuracy on C3, +8.1% on CMNLI, +3.6% on SciQ, +3.6% on JE-C, +12.3% on CAM, and +10.8% on CAP. It is also our best

automatic assistant to respond to multi-turn legal consultations, which generates all shown cases in this paper.
5 Case study
We provide several output samples from BELLE (Ji et al., 2023a), ChatGLM (Du et al., 2022) and our Lawyer LLaMA. We test the understanding of legal concepts (Table 2) and the ability to answer legal consultations (Table 3) of different models.
5.1 Legal Concepts
Understanding legal concepts is a prerequisite for solving practical legal problems. We compare the models’ abilities to explain and distinguish between legal terms.

8

We first ask three models to explain the concept community property (夫妻共同财产) in Question 1 of Table 2. BELLE has a basic understanding of this term but its interpretation is imprecise, such as the expression any property (任何财产). ChatGLM wrongly treats the joint debt (共同债务) as a type of joint property. It even talks nonsense about how the joint property is divided. By contrast, our model appropriately cites the related legal articles and concisely explains the concept.
We further ask the three models to distinguish between two similar concepts, divorce (离婚) and void marriage (无效婚姻) in Question 2 of Table 2. Both BELLE and ChatGLM misunderstand the legal concept divorce and give wrong explanations. Another problem with BELLE is that its response is too colloquial and may lead to ambiguity, such as the expression never existed (从未存在过). On the contrary, our model uses accurate expressions and comprehensively answers the question with related legal articles.
The above two examples demonstrate that Lawyer LLaMA is capable of understanding and distinguishing legal terminologies, thanks to the injection of legal knowledge by continual pretraining.

6 Conclusion
This paper proposes a method of applying LLMs to specific domains. First, the model needs to be pretrained on a large amount of domain-related text to help the model learn the necessary knowledge. Then, we need to design domain-specific tasks and use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to solve practical problems. Finally, we find that a retrieval model which provides external evidence would be very helpful to alleviate the hallucination problem and improve the reliability of the model’s responses.
Ethics Statement
The purpose of this paper is to explore how large language models can be applied to specific domains, with the legal domain chosen as an example. However, it should be noted that the data we have collected has not been rigorously vetted and may contain erroneous content, which should be used with caution. More importantly, the output of our trained model is not professional legal advice and may include errors. If you need legal assistance, please seek help from professionals.

5.2 Legal Consultations
An important objective of large pre-trained legal models is to use their legal knowledge to analyze practical cases under real-world scenarios. We compare the outputs of two legal cases from the three models.
Regarding Question 1 in Table 3, all three models give a detailed response. However, there are some logical problems in the outputs of BELLE and ChatGLM, such as the paragraphs about the child’s wishes. Our model’s output is more logically coherent and is supported by appropriately cited law articles.
Regarding Question 2 in Table 3, BELLE cites an irrelevant law article and ChatGLM confuses void marriage (无效婚姻) and voidable marriage (可撤销婚姻). Our model analyzes the case with related legal articles and gives practical advice.
In summary, the above two examples demonstrate that our model shows strong abilities to apply legal knowledge to solve real-world problems.

Question 1: 徐某（男）与李某（女）婚后育有一子（1岁半）、一女（8岁），两人准备离婚，都想争取孩子抚养 权。徐某经济状况较好，工资收入是李某的数倍，认为自己胜券在握。李某虽收入不高，但女儿更愿意随其生活。

BELLE: 好的，根据你提供的 信息，徐某和李某准备离婚， 并且两人都想争取孩子抚养 权。徐某的经济状况较好，工 资收入是李某的数倍，他认为 自己胜券在握。而李某虽然收
入不高，但女儿更愿意随其生 活。 首先，我们需要了解在中国离 婚案件中，孩子的抚养权通常 是由法院决定的。法院会根据
孩子的年龄、性别、父母的经 济状况、父母的行为、父母之 间的矛盾等因素来做出决定。 在这个案例中，徐某的经济状 况较好，但女儿更愿意随其生 活。这意味着，如果徐某能够 证明他能够提供更好的生活条 件，法院可能会给他孩子的抚 养权。 然而，如果李某能够证明她能
够提供更好的家庭环境，法院 也可能会给她孩子的抚养权。 因此，在这个案例中，法院 可能会考虑多种因素来做出决
定，而孩子的意愿只是其中之
一。

ChatGLM: 这个案例涉及到孩子抚养权 的问题，需要考虑多个因素来做出决 定。以下是一些分析和建议： 1. 孩子的年龄和需求：孩子在不同的年 龄段有不同的需求和特点。1岁半的孩 子通常需要关注他们的日常生活，如饮 食、睡眠、安全等。8岁的孩子已经进 入了青春期，需要更多的关注和支持， 以帮助他们发展社交技能和情感健康。 因此，抚养权的归属需要考虑孩子的需
求和年龄。 2. 孩子的抚养权归属需要考虑父母之 间的差异：徐某和李某的收入和职业 背景差异可能会对抚养权的归属产生影 响。但更重要的是，孩子应该由最适合 他们的人抚养。因此，需要比较双方的 性格、习惯、教育方式、家庭环境等因 素，以确定谁更适合抚养孩子。 3. 孩子的意愿：尽管李某的女儿更愿意 随其生活，但这并不代表孩子本人会同 意跟徐某生活。因此，抚养权的归属需 要考虑孩子的意愿和意愿。如果孩子愿 意跟李某生活，那么这可能会更有利于 孩子的健康成长。 4. 法律因素：根据中国的法律，孩子 的抚养权应该根据有利于孩子成长的原 则进行裁决。这意味着，徐某的经济状 况可能会对抚养权的归属产生影响。但 是，最终裁决的应该是法律程序，而不
是个人意见。 综合以上因素，如果徐某的经济状况 更好，并且孩子更愿意跟李某生活，那 么李某可能会获得孩子的抚养权。但最 终结果还需要根据法律程序来裁决，因 此，建议双方在法律框架内进行沟通和 协商，以达成一个最好的解决方案。

Lawyer LLaMA: 根据《中华人民共和 国婚姻法》的规定，子女抚养权的判 决应当以未成年子女的利益为出发点， 综合考虑父母的经济条件、身体情况、 家庭环境等情况，最终确定抚养人。因 此，在本案中，法院会综合考虑双方的 经济能力、工作时间、居住环境等因素 来判断抚养权归属问题。 首先，徐某的经济条件好，收入水平较 高，可以为孩子的成长提供更好的物质 条件。但是，如果李某能够证明自己有 更好的照顾孩子的能力，或者孩子的身 心健康需要由她来照顾，那么她也有可 能获得抚养权。 其次，女儿年龄较大，已经八岁，对于 她的意愿也应该有所考虑。如果女儿表 示愿意随母亲生活，法院也会考虑到这
一因素。 综上所述，在本案中，法院会综合考 虑双方的经济能力、照顾孩子的能力、 女儿的意愿等因素来判决抚养权归属问 题。建议双方积极沟通协商，尽量达成 一致意见，并在法律程序中维护自己的 合法权益。

Question 2: 21 岁女子甲与25 岁男子乙在网上聊天后产生好感，乙将甲发给其的私密照片保存。后乙要求与甲结婚, 甲不同意。乙威胁要公布其照片，甲只好同意结婚并办理了登记。甲是否可以自婚姻登记之日起1年内请求撤销该 婚姻？

BELLE: 根据《中华人民共和
国婚姻法》规定，婚姻登记满 一年后，双方可以提出离婚， 但需要满足一定的条件。因 此，甲可以在婚姻登记一年后 申请离婚。

ChatGLM: 根据中国《婚姻法》的规 定，婚姻关系是自婚姻开始时即存在 的，非经法定程序而不能消灭。婚姻无 效的原因有：(一)重婚的；(二)有禁止 结婚的疾病而结婚无效的；(三)因胁迫 而结婚无效的；(四)自始没有感情而结 婚无效的；(五)因欺诈而结婚无效的。 婚姻无效、可依法撤销。甲可以自婚姻 登记之日起1 年内向当地人民法院提起 撤销婚姻的诉讼。

Lawyer LLaMA: 依据《民法典》第一 千零五十二条规定，因胁迫结婚的，受 胁迫的一方可以向人民法院请求撤销婚 姻。因此，如果甲是在受到胁迫的情况 下同意结婚的，那么甲可以在自婚姻登 记之日起一年内向人民法院请求撤销婚 姻。但是，需要进一步了解的是，是否 存在胁迫的情况，以及胁迫的方式和手
段等。 另外，根据《民法典》第一千零四十六 条规定，结婚应当男女双方完全自愿， 禁止任何一方对另一方加以强迫，禁止 任何组织或者个人加以干涉。如果甲是 在完全自愿的情况下同意结婚的，那么 甲无法请求撤销婚姻。 综上所述，需要进一步了解甲同意结 婚的具体情况，以及是否存在胁迫的情 况。建议甲咨询专业律师，寻求专业的
法律帮助。

A Details of Legal Classification Tasks
For the classification task of causes of action, we collect verdicts from the website of China Courts. The website pages provide full text and humanannotated cause of action for every public judgement document. A judgement document always contains three main parts, plaintiff allegation, defence, and verdict. In this work, we first keep all judgement documents of the civil first-instance, since such documents have a similar structure and their verdicts only contain the evidence verified by Court and the decrees.
Judgement documents of the civil secondinstance are partly more complex, part of which might overrule decrees of the civil first-instance, while others support the civil first-instance. And the civil mediation documents always only contain a very simple sentence, Mediated by this Court, both litigants agree to reconciliation (经本院调 解，双方当事人一致同意撤诉). Therefore, these two kinds of judgement documents are not proper for classification tasks.
For the classification task about marriage (CAM), we select four kinds of causes of action, whose meanings have no overlapping to each other. To be detailed, we choose dispute over family affairs and succession (婚姻家庭、继承纠纷), dispute over engagement property (婚约财产纠纷), dispute over property after divorce (离婚后财产纠 纷), and dispute over a void marriage (婚姻无效纠 纷). We sample 4,875 verdicts from all judgement documents, whose text lengths are between 150 and 500 characters. Among them, 3,895 verdicts are examples of the training set, and the other 980 ones for the test set.
For the classification task about property (CAP), we use similar rules to sample 70,000 verdicts for training and 30,000 for testing. We select ten kinds of causes of action about property, which are all common causes that appear on the website of China Courts. Specifically, they are (1) dispute over land contract in rural areas (农村土地承包合同纠纷), (2) dispute over a rural house purchase contract (农 村房屋买卖合同纠纷), (3) dispute over a commodity house contract (商品房销售合同纠纷), (4) dispute over a house lease contract (房屋租赁合同纠纷), (5) dispute over ill-gotten gains (不当得利纠纷), (6) dispute over a small-sum loan contract (小额借款合 同纠纷), (7) dispute over employment contract (劳动 合同纠纷), (8) dispute over labour contract (劳务合 同纠纷), (9) dispute over alimony (抚养费纠纷), and

(10) dispute over repayment of ancestor’s debts (被 继承人债务清偿纠纷).
It is also worth noting that the training sets are not used when evaluating the zero-shot performance of the model at every stage. The results in Table 1 are all based on the test set (if existing, otherwise the validation set).

Question: 关于交通肇事罪与其他犯罪关系的 论述，下列选项是正确的吗？丁酒后驾驶交 通肇事后，继续驾车到处冲撞，造成五死九
伤，应定交通肇事罪。

Question: Is the following statement about the relationship between the crime of traffic accident and other crimes correct?After Bob drove under the influence of alcohol and caused a traffic accident, he continued driving and crashed into various places, resulting in five deaths and nine injuries. He should be charged with the crime of traffic accident.

Response: 根据《中华人民共和国刑法》规 定，醉酒后驾驶机动车辆，发生重大交通事 故，构成交通肇事罪。丁酒后驾驶发生交通 事故，已经构成交通肇事罪。但是，丁继续 驾车到处冲撞，造成五死九伤，已经超出了
交通肇事罪的范畴，应当认定为危害公共安 全罪。因此，丁应当被定罪为危害公共安全
罪，而不是交通肇事罪。

Response: According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and causing a serious traffic accident constitutes the crime of traffic accident. After driving under the influence, Bob caused a traffic accident, which has already constituted the crime of traffic accident. However, Bob continued to drive and collided everywhere, resulting in five deaths and nine injuries, which goes beyond the scope of the crime of traffic accident and should be identified as the crime of endangering public safety. Therefore, Bob should be convicted of the crime of endangering public safety instead of the crime of traffic accident.

Question 1: What is community property?

BELLE: Community property refers to any property acquired by a married couple during their marital relationship, including but not limited to wages, bonuses, stocks, real estate, and so on.

ChatGLM: Community property refers to the property accumulated jointly by both parties during the marriage, including the jointly owned house, jointly owned assets, income such as wages and bonuses paid jointly, as well as jointly debt, etc. According to Chinese law, community property refers to the property accumulated jointly by both parties during the marriage, unless otherwise agreed upon. Upon divorce, the community property of husband and wife should be divided equally. The proportion of division of community property is determined through negotiation between the husband and wife. If no agreement can be reached, the following proportions shall be applied: (1) The proportion of property acquired by the wife should be lower than that of the husband; (2) The proportion of property acquired by the wife should be lower than the proportion of property acquired by the husband; ...

Lawyer LLaMA: Community property refers to the wages, bonuses, remuneration for labor, proceeds from production, operation, investment, and intellectual property rights, as well as property acquired through inheritance or gift during the existence of the marriage, and other property that should be jointly owned. According to Article 1062 of the Civil Code, the community property of a husband and wife belongs to both of them jointly, and they have equal rights to deal with the community property. Therefore, the community property of a husband and wife is jointly owned by both parties, and both husband and wife have the right to enjoy and manage it.

Question 2: What is the difference between divorce and void marriage?

BELLE: The difference between divorce and void marriage lies in the fact that divorce refers to the termination of a marital relationship, while a void marriage refers to a marital relationship that never existed.

ChatGLM: Divorce and void marriage refer to two different states within the institution of marriage. Divorce signifies that the marital relationship has become void or has been revoked, and both parties can terminate the marriage through legal procedures. The effectiveness of divorce depends on the reasons for the marriage’s invalidity. If the marriage is deemed void due to a lack of affection between the parties or a failure to comply with legal requirements, then the divorce is considered valid. However, if the marriage is void due to inherent issues such as violating law articles or lacking affection, then the divorce is considered void. On the other hand, a void marriage refers to a marital relationship that has not been legally established or has inherent defects despite being legally recognized. The effectiveness of a void marriage also depends on the reasons for its invalidity. If the marriage is deemed void due to a lack of affection between the parties or a failure to comply with legal requirements, then the marriage is considered void. However, if the marriage is void due to inherent issues such as violating law articles or lacking affection, then the marriage is considered void. Therefore, the difference between divorce and a void marriage lies in the reasons for the marriage’s invalidity and its effectiveness. Divorce signifies that the marital relationship has become void or has been revoked, whereas a void marriage refers to a marital relationship that has not been legally established or has inherent defects despite being legally recognized.

Lawyer LLaMA: Divorce and void marriage are two different situations. Divorce refers to the voluntary termination of the marital relationship by both parties, while a void marriage refers to a situation where the marital relationship was not established from the beginning or has been deemed void under certain circumstances. According to Article 1051 of the Civil Code, a marriage will be considered void if any of the following circumstances exist: bigamy, prohibited kinship, or failure to meet the legal marriage age requirement. If a marriage is declared void, the spouses do not possess the rights and obligations of a married couple, and the issue of divorce does not arise. Regarding the property division of a void marriage, as stipulated in Article 1054 of the Civil Code, a void or revoked marriage has no legal binding force from the beginning. The property acquired during cohabitation is to be handled by the parties through an agreement. In case of failure to reach an agreement, the People’s Court will make a judgment based on the principle of taking care of the innocent party. Furthermore, the property division in cases of void marriage resulting from bigamy must not infringe upon the property rights and interests of the parties in lawful marriage. In addition, Article 1063 of the Civil Code defines the scope of joint property and personal property for spouses, with one party’s premarital property classified as personal property. Therefore, if a marriage is deemed void, the premarital property of both spouses remains individually owned. In conclusion, divorce and void marriage are two different situations that require judgment based on specific circumstances. If you need further understanding of related legal issues, it is recommended to consult a professional

Question 1: Mr. Xu (male) and Ms. Li (female) have a son (1 and a half years old) and a daughter (8 years old) after their marriage. They are planning to get a divorce and both want to fight for custody of the children.Mr. Xu is in a better financial condition, with a salary several times higher than Ms. Li’s, and he believes he has the upper hand. Although Ms. Li’s income is not high, their daughter prefers to live with her.

BELLE: Okay, based on the information you provided, Mr. Xu and Ms. Li are preparing for a divorce, and both of them want to fight for custody of their child. Mr. Xu is in a better financial condition, with a salary several times higher than Ms. Li’s, and he believes he has the upper hand. However, although Ms. Li has a lower income, their daughter prefers to live with her. First, we need to understand that in divorce cases in China, the custody of the child is usually determined by the court. The court takes into account factors such as the child’s age, gender, parents’ financial condition, parents’ behavior, and conflicts between the parents to make a decision. In this case, Mr. Xu has a better financial condition, but their daughter prefers to live with Ms. Li. This means that if Mr. Xu can prove that he can provide better living conditions, the court may grant him custody of the child. However, if Ms. Li can prove that she can provide a better family environment, the court may grant her custody of the child. Therefore, in this case, the court may consider multiple factors to make a decision, and the child’s preference is just one of them.

ChatGLM: This case involves the issue of child custody and requires considering multiple factors to make a decision. Here are some analysis and recommendations: 1. Child’s age and needs: Children have different needs and characteristics at different stages of their lives. A one-and-a-half-yearold child typically requires attention to their daily life, such as diet, sleep, and safety. An eight-year-old child has entered adolescence and requires more attention and support to help them develop social skills and emotional well-being. Therefore, the allocation of custody needs to consider the child’s needs and age. 2. Parental differences: The income and occupational background differences between Xu and Li may impact the custody decision. However, more importantly, the child should be raised by the person who is best suited for them. Therefore, it is necessary to compare factors such as personalities, habits, parenting styles, and family environment to determine who is more suitable for raising the child. 3. Child’s wishes: Although Li’s daughter may prefer to live with her, it does not necessarily mean the child would agree to live with Xu. Therefore, the allocation of custody needs to consider the child’s wishes and preferences. If the child is willing to live with Li, it may be more beneficial for the child’s healthy development. 4. Legal factors: According to Chinese law, the custody of a child should be decided based on what is in the best interest of the child’s growth. This means that Xu’s financial situation may influence the custody decision. However, the final decision should be based on legal procedures rather than personal opinions. Considering the above factors, if Xu has a better financial situation and the child is more willing to live with Li, Li may be granted custody of the child. However, the final outcome should be determined through legal procedures. Therefore, it is recommended that both parties engage in communication and negotiation within the legal framework to reach the best possible solution.

Lawyer LLaMA: According to the provisions of the Marriage Law of the People’s Republic of China, the judgment of child custody should be based on the best interests of the minor children, taking into account the parents’ economic conditions, physical health, family environment, and other factors, and ultimately determining the custodian. Therefore, in this case, the court will consider the parties’ economic ability, working hours, living environment, and other factors to determine the issue of child custody. Firstly, Xu has a good financial condition and a higher income, which can provide better material conditions for the child’s upbringing. However, if Li can prove that she has a better ability to take care of the child or that the child’s physical and mental health needs to be taken care of by her, she may also obtain custody. Secondly, the daughter is older, already eight years old, and her wishes should also be taken into consideration. If the daughter expresses a willingness to live with her mother, the court will also take this factor into account. In conclusion, in this case, the court will comprehensively consider the parties’ economic ability, caregiving ability, the daughter’s wishes, and other factors in determining the issue of child custody. It is recommended that both parties actively communicate and negotiate, try to reach a consensus, and protect their legitimate rights and interests through legal procedures.

Question 2: A 21-year-old woman, referred to as Alice, developed a liking for a 25-year-old man, referred to as Bob, after chatting online. Bob saved the private photos sent by Alice. Later, Bob asked Alice to marry him, but she refused. Bob threatened to publish her photos, so Alice reluctantly agreed to marry him and completed the registration. Can Alice request to dissolve the marriage within one year from the date of marriage registration?

BELLE: According to the Marriage Law of the People’s Republic of China, after one year of marriage registration, both parties can apply for a divorce, but certain conditions need to be met. Therefore, Party A can apply for a divorce after one year of marriage registration.

ChatGLM: According to the provisions of the Chinese Marriage Law, a marital relationship exists from the beginning of the marriage and cannot be terminated without legal procedures. The reasons for the invalidity of marriage are as follows: (1) bigamy; (2) marriage void due to a disease that prohibits marriage; (3) marriage void due to coercion; (4) marriage void due to lack of emotional attachment from the beginning; (5) marriage void due to fraud. void marriages can be revoked according to the law. Party A can file a lawsuit to revoke the marriage within one year from the date of marriage registration with the local People’s Court.

Lawyer LLaMA: According to Article 1,052 of the Civil Code, if a marriage is contracted under coercion, the coerced party may request the court to revoke the marriage. Therefore, if Party A agreed to marry under coercion, Party A can request the court to revoke the marriage within one year from the date of marriage registration. However, it is necessary to further understand whether there was coercion, as well as the methods and means of coercion. Furthermore, according to Article 1,046 of the Civil Code, marriage should be based on the full voluntary will of both parties, and it is prohibited for either party to coerce the other or for any organization or individual to interfere. If Party A agreed to marry under full voluntary will, Party A cannot request the revocation of the marriage. In conclusion, it is necessary to further understand the specific circumstances of Party A’s agreement to marry and whether there was coercion. It is advised that Party A consults a professional lawyer to seek specialized legal assistance.
